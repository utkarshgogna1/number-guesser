## Features

- **Draw a digit (0â€“9)** on the screen.
- **Model trained on MNIST** to guess which digit you drew.
- **Uses a simple neural network** built with TensorFlow and Keras.
- **Interactive interface** thanks to Pygame and/or Tkinter.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.6 or below**  
- **TensorFlow** (GPU version recommended)  
- **Keras** (often included with newer TensorFlow)  
- **Numpy**  
- **Matplotlib**  
- **Pygame**  
- **Tkinter** (usually included with Python)
